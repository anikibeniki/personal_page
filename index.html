      Hey, I'm Anita - I am on a mission to help people manage their finances better.
My background is in banking as I used to work at Revolut so I know what it feels like to be on the inside of a company that has experienced an explosive growth trajectory.
I learned how important it is for companies to have a clear understanding of Finance. It really resonated with me - so much so that today, I am building LiveFlow.io - one hub to automate your company finances.
 </p>
<p>I also love coffee â˜•  - yes you guessed it right - and avocado toast ðŸ¥‘ Apart from that, my favourite thing to do when I have some free time is running! I've been doing it for a while now, but my most memorable run was the one where I ran from London Heathrow Airport to Buckingham Palace (just kidding).
